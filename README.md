Investment is a business activity that most people are.interested in this globalization era. There are several objects that are often used for investment, for example, gold, stocks and property.

House prices increase every year, so there is a need for a system to predict house prices in the future. House price prediction can help the developer determine the selling price of a house and can help the customer to arrange the right time to purchase a house.
